Ryan's (my own) code encapsulates using the rosenbrock function to producing input, generating input samples and performing cross validation, making weight matrixes to emulate layers of nodes, and assessing function output.
Lizzie's code encapsulates EVERYTHING ELSE (backprop, matrix multiplication, feed forward, nodeular activation functions, weight updating)

Objectively, while we both did our best to produce the code we'd need, I can admit Lizzie did most of the heavy lifting as I failed to produce anything useful code wise for the 3rd week of the assignment as I was still trying to fully comprehend the problem at that point.
